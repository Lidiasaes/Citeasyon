# Citeasyon ‚ú® 
## Cite in MLA or APA format easily... with LLAMA2
üñ•Ô∏è[**Citeasyon Interface YOUTUBE TUTORIAL**](https://youtu.be/gNYaxPK_OB0?feature=shared)

Streamlit app to get automatic MLA or APA citations from input files (.txt or .pdf).
This project was done using **Colaboratory** environment and GPU access. As GPU resources are limited, Citeasyon was forced to be cut into 2 steps.
You are required to use your own **Hugging Face Access Token** in order to be able to run these two apps (step 1 and step 2).


*Citeasyon step 1*

*Citeasyon step 2*

**How to use it?**
1. Run the Colaboratory notebook cell by cell.
2. The last cell will return an output similar to this one:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
 
Local URL: http://localhost:8501

Network URL: http://123.45.6.78:8501

External URL: http://12.345.678.90:8501
 
 
npx: installed 22 in 2.441s
 
your url is: https://nice-forks-start.loca.lt
```

3. In 'External URL', copy the number appearing between https and the port (:8501). In this example: 12.345.678.90
4. Click in 'your url is:'. It will pop up a new window.
5. Paste the number you copied in step 3. Click 'Submit'. It will start running :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:




This is a very versatile project. You can modify the prompts, change the llm you want to use or add more columns (example: topic detection).
