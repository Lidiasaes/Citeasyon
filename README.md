# Citeasyon ✨
Streamlit app to get automatic MLA or APA citations from input files (.txt or .pdf).
This project was done using **Colaboratory** environment and GPU access. As GPU resources are limited, Citeasyon was forced to be cut into 2 steps.
You are required to use your own **Hugging Face Access Token** in order to be able to run these two apps (step 1 and step 2).

This is a very versatile project. You can modify the prompts, change the llm you want to use or add more columns (example: topic detection).
